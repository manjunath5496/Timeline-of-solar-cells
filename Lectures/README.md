<h2 id="course3">Introduction to Drama</h2>
<p>This course requires submission of analytic response papers (2-3 pages each) on four of the plays read or attended; a theatrical scene, with dialogue (3-5 pages); and a major paper&nbsp;(<a href="essay_assignmt.pdf">PDF</a>).&nbsp;There is also a final exam.&nbsp;In addition, during the latter half of the course, students are required to lead the discussion of one play, and to perform in a scene from it as part of that process. They must also give a brief (5-minute) presentation based on the research paper, sharing their most interesting insights with the class.</p>
<h2 class="subhead">Student Questions</h2>
<p>Student questions regarding&nbsp;<em>Death and the King's Horseman</em>&nbsp;were collected anonymously during the term and are summarized in the following document.</p>
